= Architecture

The sondbus suite of protocols can be divided into two major layers:

- Transfer Layer
- Application Layer

== Transfer Layer

The transfer layer is responsible for moving data between a master and its slaves.
It essentially defines a protocol for the master to remotely access a memory region in slaves by addressing them in various ways.

Based on the underlying communcation method, the transfer layer can operate in one of the following modes:

- Framed
- Unframed


== Application Layer
